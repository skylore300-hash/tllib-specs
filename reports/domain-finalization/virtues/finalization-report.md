# Virtues domain finalization report

## Scope and baseline

Virtues was finalized from `main` HEAD `c34d40713bf444d38f92f76e1c6239ee596d5a18` on branch `phase4/virtues-domain-finalization-001`.

The authoritative global baseline and domain feature matrix identify exactly ten active features:

1. `TLC-FC-10-VIRTUES-001`
2. `TLC-FC-10-VIRTUES-002`
3. `TLC-FC-10-VIRTUES-005`
4. `TLC-FC-10-VIRTUES-006`
5. `TLC-FC-10-VIRTUES-007`
6. `TLC-FC-10-VIRTUES-008`
7. `TLC-FC-10-VIRTUES-009`
8. `TLC-FC-10-VIRTUES-010`
9. `TLC-FC-10-VIRTUES-011`
10. `TLC-FC-10-VIRTUES-014`

Each feature already had a source mathematical contract, source IR, and source structural test plan. Those artifacts remain authoritative and unchanged.

## Finalization result

Every active feature now has:

- a finalized implementation IR under `registry/optimized-ir/virtues/`;
- a directly implementable algorithm specification under `registry/algorithms/virtues/`;
- an acceptance oracle under `registry/oracles/virtues/`;
- module integration in `registry/domain-finalization/virtues/module-specification.yaml`;
- a future developer task in `registry/domain-finalization/virtues/implementation-tasks.yaml`.

The selected status is `selected_for_virtues_implementation_specification`. It selects a software working specification only and makes no new scientific or normative decision.

## Feature outcomes

| Feature | Public operation | Finalized behavior | Aptitude |
|---|---|---|---|
| `001` | `check_apprenticeship_responsibility` | Validate and preserve a source-bound responsibility handoff record | Structural implementation |
| `002` | `register_observational_learning_assumption` | Register opaque exposure claims and propagate scientific ambiguity | Declarative structural implementation |
| `005` | `package_developmental_dynamics_rhs` | Package supplied symbolic right-hand-side terms | Symbolic representation implementation |
| `006` | `register_virtue_equation_forms` | Register forms, free symbols, opaque operators, and candidate links | Declarative structural implementation |
| `007` | `check_virtue_function_invariant` | Preserve source-declared function labels as labels only | Structural validation implementation |
| `008` | `build_measure_observation_ledger` | Build a structural ledger from supplied observations | Structural observation implementation |
| `009` | `register_quantitative_measure_reservations` | Register named dimensions with absent scales and thresholds | Declarative structural implementation |
| `010` | `register_essential_property_indicators` | Register opaque indicator categories and progression descriptors | Declarative structural implementation |
| `011` | `package_vice_diagnostic_function` | Package supplied vice evidence and supplied development-domain labels | Structural observation-relation implementation |
| `014` | `map_contextual_virtue_relations` | Preserve supplied contextual relation claims without endpoint inference | Declarative relation implementation |

No feature was rejected, merged, renumbered, or removed.

## Shared patterns

The demonstrated common patterns are:

- a source-bound request envelope containing feature id, artifact, provenance, and reservations;
- a source-bound accepted or rejected result envelope;
- exact feature-id validation;
- complete source-object provenance validation;
- structured common errors: `missing_provenance`, `unsupported_scientific_completion_request`, and `invalid_feature_id`;
- opaque virtue, evidence, context, relation endpoint, and metric-descriptor representations;
- deterministic pass-through of opaque values;
- exact propagation of unresolved items;
- observation without evaluation;
- relation mapping without endpoint identity inference.

Resemblance, textual duplication, structural duplication, shared representation schema, and scientific equivalence remain distinct classifications. No scientific equivalence was inferred.

## Optimizations applied

The finalized IRs factor and normalize only demonstrated structural duplication:

- common request and result envelopes;
- common provenance and feature-id validation;
- common error policy;
- common opaque-value and unresolved propagation;
- normalized traceability and explicit execution order;
- explicit separation between representation, observation, relation mapping, evaluation, comparison, and evolution.

Feature-specific entrypoints and behaviors remain separate. Source-object order is preserved because semantic irrelevance of order was not demonstrated.

## Scientific and implementation boundaries

The source includes mathematical and descriptive material concerning measurement, development, dynamics, and relations. Existing contracts and domain registries do not select all required scales, thresholds, parameters, operators, comparison rules, or execution semantics. Therefore this package does not:

- compute a virtue score or moral grade;
- create a hierarchy, priority, weight, or order;
- choose a metric, scale, threshold, unit, or calibration;
- numerically integrate developmental or vice-virtue dynamics;
- solve equation forms;
- derive an observational-learning or acquisition algorithm;
- infer a psychological diagnosis or prescribe correction;
- compare virtues;
- resolve cross-domain endpoint identities;
- convert documentary dependencies into execution dependencies.

## Decisions and blockers

There are no blockers preventing this implementation-specification package from closing. Scientific ambiguity remains explicitly propagated for `002`, `009`, and `010`. Numerical execution, equation solving, evaluation, diagnosis, correction, and cross-domain resolution remain non-blocking future scientific or implementation-scope decisions.

The detailed classifications are in `registry/domain-finalization/virtues/decision-required.yaml`.

## Preservation statement

- Source contracts are preserved and unchanged.
- Source IRs are preserved and unchanged.
- `maths/10-virtues/virtues.md` is preserved and unchanged.
- No virtue, hierarchy, priority, score, measurement, comparison, manifestation, acquisition condition, or normative consequence was invented.
- No artifact belonging to another domain was modified.
- No global registry was regenerated.
- No C++ code, Python binding, or reference implementation was produced.

## Closure

Virtues is complete through the algorithm-and-oracle package and is ready for future implementation work against the finalized specifications and acceptance oracles.
