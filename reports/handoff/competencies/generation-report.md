# Competencies Feature Handoff Generation Report

## Scope

- Domain: `competencies` (index 12)
- Package model: Feature Handoff Package v1.0
- Authoritative inventory: `registry/domain-finalization/competencies/feature-status.yaml`
- Primary scientific source: `maths/12-competencies/competencies.md`
- Expected active features: 13
- Produced feature packages: 13

## Produced population

1. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-001`
2. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-002`
3. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-004`
4. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-005`
5. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-006`
6. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-007`
7. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-008`
8. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-009`
9. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-010`
10. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-011`
11. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-012`
12. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-013`
13. `TLC-FC-12-COMPETENCIES-016`

Each package contains `README.md`, `manifest.json`, `contract.json`, `acceptance.json`, and `traceability.json`. No `examples.json` was generated because the upstream evidence supplies structural acceptance cases but no honest normative scientific values.

## Compilation decisions

All active Competencies features are structurally implementable but scientifically non-executable. The handoff contracts therefore expose exact feature and object identity validation, provenance preservation, immutable descriptor construction, stable authoritative errors, deterministic semantic output, and rejection of all unsupported scientific evaluation.

Algorithm step lists were treated as compilation inputs. Only the necessary partial order is normative: structural validation must succeed before descriptor construction and publication. The order among independent validation checks and all internal architecture remain implementation-defined.

The source inventory uses the accepted aliases `domain_id` and `population_count`. The domain catalog uses the normalized handoff schema names `domain` and `expected_feature_count`. No source inventory, schema, validator, or shared contract was changed to address this editorial nomenclature difference.

## Preserved unresolved semantics

All 13 packages preserve unresolved scientific semantics and expose only structural descriptor behavior.

- Features `004` and `006` preserve the Capacities dependency as `external_unreconciled` scientific-documentary metadata with `runtime_required=false`; no cross-domain runtime integration was invented.
- Feature `008` preserves four distinct ObjectIds (`108` through `111`) despite their shared canonical name; name equality never implies identity or equivalence.
- Feature `016` preserves `covered_relations=[]`, unresolved endpoints, and forbidden endpoint inference.
- Source types such as `Metric`, `Function`, `Operator`, and `Relation` remain descriptive and non-executable.

## Shared contracts

Only existing handoff shared contracts are referenced. No shared contract was created or modified. One recurring local structural-descriptor profile is recorded as a candidate only in `shared-contract-candidates.json`; semantic differences between categories, boundaries, dependencies, identity rules, and relation endpoints prevent local promotion to a shared contract.

## Write-scope confirmation

Changes are limited to:

- Competencies feature-package directories under `handoff/features/`
- `handoff/domains/competencies/`
- `reports/handoff/competencies/`

No scientific source, mathematical contract, source IR, finalized IR, algorithm, oracle, test plan, schema, shared contract, validator, workflow, global catalog, implementation code, or package from another domain was modified.

## Validation

The feature population, exact object memberships, traceability paths, authoritative errors, and write scope were checked during compilation. Repository schema and cross-file validation are delegated to `tools/handoff/validate_handoff.py` and GitHub Actions. Final CI evidence is recorded in `validation-report.json`.
