# Evaluation 18 — Generation report

## Publication record

Domain **18 — Evaluation / Évaluation** is finalized as an implementation-ready Feature Handoff domain on the dedicated publication branch. The deterministic global catalog has been materialized with the permanent generator for the combined publication state of **24 domains / 264 features / 8 shared contracts**.

This versioned report intentionally does not embed the final PR HEAD, GitHub Actions run IDs, or squash-merge SHA. Those values exist only after the commit containing this report and are therefore recorded in PR #150 and GitHub merge history, avoiding a self-referential commit/CI loop.

## Scientific authority

## Baseline and published target

Initial `main` SHA observed at mission start:

`b93b2720338dc4327f565cc2c0ce33b072d122b2`

Initial global model:

- domains: 23
- features: 244
- shared contracts: 8

Evaluation publication model:

- domains: 24
- features: 264
- shared contracts: 8
- `evaluation` appended after `reflexivity` in the existing publication order

The extension registry publishes only domain 18 in this mission. Regulation 19, Robustness 20, Fairness 21, Drift and correction 32, and Fidelity to invariant core 35 remain unpublished.

## Scientific inventory

Frozen Evaluation inventory:

- candidate scientific objects: **82**
- candidate scientific relations: **32**
- unresolved scientific items: **20**

Primary inventory files:

- `registry/domain-progress/evaluation/source-inventory.yaml`
- `registry/domain-progress/evaluation/feature-inventory.yaml`
- `registry/domain-progress/evaluation/feature-dependencies.yaml`
- `registry/scientific-objects/evaluation/scientific-objects.candidate.yaml`
- `registry/scientific-objects/evaluation/scientific-relations.candidate.yaml`
- `registry/scientific-objects/evaluation/unresolved-terms.yaml`

Preserved unresolved science includes the global dimension equality ambiguity and `V`/`Val` convention, missing reflexive metric family for `M_r`, missing autonomous `E_community` formula, undefined `E_truth`, undefined `N_i` and several min/max or optimal references, opaque thresholds and `sigma`, unspecified norms/projections/gradients/derivatives/integrals/expectations/statistical estimators, empty peer-population semantics, aggregation minima/autonomy policy, efficiency orientation, and incomplete transition-process semantics.

## Execution classification

- `executable`: **1** (`TLC-FC-18-EVALUATION-016`)
- `conditionally_executable`: **17** (`001–015`, `017`, `018`)
- `structural_only`: **2** (`019`, `020`)

Scientific-status distribution:

- `defined`: 1
- `external_provider_required`: 12
- `preserved_unresolved`: 7

## Guards and structured non-execution

The finalized contracts and algorithms explicitly preserve, among others:

- validity/reliability threshold provider guards;
- norm, `sigma`, derivative, second-derivative, gradient, projection, expectation and integral provider guards;
- metric denominator guards with no hidden clamp;
- `ReflexiveMetricProviderRequired` for complete integrated progression without `M_r` metrics;
- `CommunityEvaluationUnavailable` for complete four-source aggregation without externally supplied community evaluation;
- `TruthSignalProviderRequired` for mentor-weight learning without `E_truth`;
- `PeerPopulationEmpty` before peer-average division when `P_d(t)=∅`;
- `NormalizerProviderRequired` and metric-range guards for `I_progression`;
- source-weight sum/minimum/mentor-before-autonomy constraint errors with no silent renormalization or simplex projection;
- threshold-ordering guard with no silent sorting/calibration;
- conditional-population consistency guard for the type-conditional bias metric;
- raw efficiency output with no invented higher-is-better/lower-is-better orientation.

## Produced artifact families

For each of the 20 features, the publication contains:

- mathematical contract: `registry/math-contracts/<FEATURE_ID>/contract.yaml`
- candidate IR: `ir/<FEATURE_ID>/ir.candidate.json`
- registered IR: `registry/ir/<FEATURE_ID>/ir.yaml`
- test plan: `registry/test-plans/<FEATURE_ID>/test-plan.yaml`
- optimized IR: `registry/optimized-ir/evaluation/<FEATURE_ID>/ir.yaml`
- algorithm/guard descriptor: `registry/algorithms/evaluation/<FEATURE_ID>/algorithm.yaml`
- oracle: `registry/oracles/evaluation/<FEATURE_ID>/oracle.yaml`
- Feature Handoff Package with exactly `README.md`, `manifest.json`, `contract.json`, `acceptance.json`, and `traceability.json`

Domain finalization files:

- `registry/domain-finalization/evaluation/manifest.yaml`
- `registry/domain-finalization/evaluation/feature-status.yaml`
- `registry/domain-finalization/evaluation/patterns.yaml`
- `registry/domain-finalization/evaluation/module-specification.yaml`
- `registry/domain-finalization/evaluation/implementation-tasks.yaml`

Domain handoff catalog:

- `handoff/domains/evaluation/catalog.json`
- canonical Feature Handoff Domain Catalog v1.0 shape
- population: `complete`
- validation: `validated`
- exactly 20 finalized feature-package entries
- exactly the existing 8 shared dependencies

## Shared contracts

Exactly the existing eight shared contracts are reused:

1. `TLC-HC-FEATURE-ID`
2. `TLC-HC-SCIENTIFIC-REFERENCE`
3. `TLC-HC-REFERENCE-COLLECTION`
4. `TLC-HC-UNRESOLVED-ITEM`
5. `TLC-HC-OPAQUE-VALUE`
6. `TLC-HC-STRUCTURED-ERROR`
7. `TLC-HC-TRACEABILITY`
8. `TLC-HC-DESCRIPTOR-ENVELOPE`

No ninth shared contract is introduced.

## Global publication state

`registry/domain-progress/extension-16-35.yaml` encodes Evaluation 18 with:

- `feature_count: 20`
- `handoff_publication: true`
- no confirmed Evaluation dependency on Regulation
- complete pipeline states for the Evaluation publication

`tools/domain-progress/validate_extension_16_35.py` permits the published extension set:

`{16, 18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27}`

`tools/handoff/model.py` encodes:

- `EXPECTED_DOMAIN_COUNT = 24`
- `EXPECTED_FEATURE_COUNT = 264`
- `EXPECTED_SHARED_CONTRACT_COUNT = 8`
- `evaluation` appended to `DOMAIN_ORDER`

The global `handoff/catalog.json` is the deterministic output of the permanent `tools/handoff/generate_catalog.py` for this exact 24-domain / 264-feature model. It is not reconstructed from Git blob hashes and no generator instrumentation is used.

## Validation evidence policy

Before the final merge, the exact unchanged PR HEAD must have both permanent GitHub workflows in `completed/success` state:

- **Feature handoff validation**;
- **Global finalization validation**.

Reviews and review threads must also be clear, and `main` must remain unchanged from the reconciled base. The immutable final HEAD, run IDs, review state, squash SHA and final `main` SHA are recorded in PR #150 and GitHub history rather than embedded here.

## Repository hygiene

- `maths/18-evaluation/evaluation.md` is unchanged;
- no `TLC-FC-19-*` artifact is created;
- no Regulation 19 implementation is created;
- no Fairness 21, Robustness 20, Drift 32, or Fidelity 35 publication artifact is created;
- `tools/handoff/generate_catalog.py` is not modified or instrumented;
- no `tools/handoff/materialize_catalog.py` or equivalent helper is created;
- no temporary workflow is created;
- `.github/workflows/handoff.yml` is unchanged and remains read-only (`contents: read`);
- no runtime C++, Python binding, solver, optimizer, integrator, estimator framework, state machine, or promotion engine is added.

## Pull request

Publication PR: **#150 — Finalize domain 18 Evaluation to implementation-ready handoffs**.

Sourcery reported that the diff exceeded its automated review size limit and created no actionable review thread. Final immutable CI and merge evidence belongs to the PR conversation/description and repository history.
