- Scientific provider: domain 04 Invariants, source blob `5bddc38b4a74465c2bc3b1d2e9f8aac004e86800`
- Confirmed scientific dependency: `28 -> 04`
- Runtime dependencies: none
- Rejected direct dependencies: `28 -> 29`, `28 -> 30`, `28 -> 31`
- Locked Wave 3 order: `28 -> 29 -> 30 -> 31`
- Domains 29, 30 and 31 remain unpublished by this publication.

Domain 04 is a scientific authority only. No compatible published feature binding is claimed for `pi_N`, set-level projection, `P_pres`, invariant-core distance, or preservation probability.

## Preserved scientific boundaries

The publication explicitly preserves all of the following without repair or invention:

- goal-space manifold is declared but no atlas, metric, topology engine, manifold implementation, or sampler is constructed;
- set inclusion `G_imm subset G_int subset G_ult` is not equated to a temporal/procedural stage machine;
- `d_real` keeps its infimum formulation and supplies no minimizer, nearest-point, projection, or geodesic solver;
- final-attractor membership keeps strict `P_pres > theta`, with no flow/basin/asymptotic solver and no threshold calibration;
- update operator `U` remains an opaque provider;
- `||pi_N(y)-pi_N(G)|| < epsilon` remains strict and `pi_N(G)` keeps undefined set-level projection semantics;
- objective term `+ Psi(P_pres)` remains source-signed with direction/monotonicity unresolved;
- Hamiltonian remains `p·F - L + lambda P_pres`; the preservation-term sign interpretation remains unresolved;
- HJB remains a scientific condition with no PDE/HJB/minimizer/value-iteration/policy-iteration engine;
- auto-finalization exposes only the RHS from externally supplied `G_em`, gradients and context derivative;
- `G_em` remains provider-backed; no center-of-gravity construction is invented;
- state-goal-control equations remain structural; no `argmin` solver, controller, trajectory optimizer, MPC or ODE engine is introduced;
- convergence and preservation theorems remain conditional and are not runtime certificates;
- the claim that `P_pres = theta` is repulsive remains unproved; no barrier/safety/invariance certificate is invented;
- contextual convergence remains conditional/evidence-backed;
- `lambda_tel = lim (1/t) ln d_real` preserves the source sign, including negative values under exponential decay; no negation or absolute value is applied;
- `eta_tel` requires a supplied discounted integral and guards `T=0` without hidden quadrature;
- `R_tel = exp(-d_real)` is exact, unclamped, and carries no automatic `[0,1]` claim without separate nonnegativity evidence;
- `theta`, `epsilon`, `alpha(t)`, `beta(t)`, `alpha_G`, `beta_G`, `gamma_G`, `lambda`, `rho`, and `T` are not calibrated.

## Artifact population

For every one of the 22 features the branch contains:
- one mathematical contract;
- one candidate IR;
- one registered IR;
- one test plan;
- one optimized IR;
- one algorithm/guard/descriptor specification;
- one oracle;
- one autonomous implementation task;
- one Feature Handoff Package with exactly `README.md`, `manifest.json`, `contract.json`, `acceptance.json`, `traceability.json`.

The domain catalog is `handoff/domains/finality-and-evolutionary-teleology/catalog.json` with expected feature count 22 and terminal status `population=complete`, `validation=validated`.

Exactly the existing 8 shared contracts are reused. No ninth shared contract is introduced.

## Global population

Baseline on the publication base:
- domains: **29**
- features: **373**
- shared contracts: **8**

Target after Finality publication:
- domains: **30**
- features: **395**
- shared contracts: **8**

`finality-and-evolutionary-teleology` is appended to the end of `DOMAIN_ORDER`; historical ordering is not re-sorted.
