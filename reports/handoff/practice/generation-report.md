## Artifact audit

For every feature, the compiler found and used:

- one mathematical contract in `registry/math-contracts/<FEATURE-ID>/contract.yaml`;
- one source IR in `registry/ir/<FEATURE-ID>/ir.yaml`;
- one canonical test plan in `registry/test-plans/<FEATURE-ID>/test-plan.yaml`;
- one finalized IR in `registry/optimized-ir/practice/<FEATURE-ID>/ir.yaml`;
- one algorithm specification in `registry/algorithms/practice/<FEATURE-ID>/algorithm.yaml`;
- one acceptance oracle in `registry/oracles/practice/<FEATURE-ID>/oracle.yaml`;
- the Practice domain-finalization manifest, feature status, module specification, pattern analysis, implementation tasks, and decision registry;
- the scientific source `maths/13-practice/practice.md` through preserved traceability only.

No alternate `ir/<FEATURE-ID>/` population was discovered. No artifact population divergence or duplicate feature identity was found.

## Package outputs

Each feature directory contains exactly:

- `README.md`
- `manifest.json`
- `contract.json`
- `acceptance.json`
- `traceability.json`

`examples.json` is omitted for every feature because the sources and oracles provide structural assertions but no honest normative scientific value fixture.

The domain outputs are:

- `handoff/domains/practice/catalog.json`
- `reports/handoff/practice/generation-report.md`
- `reports/handoff/practice/ambiguities.json`
- `reports/handoff/practice/shared-contract-candidates.json`
- `reports/handoff/practice/validation-report.json`

## Compilation decisions

### Observable contract

All packages expose deterministic structural construction, validation, canonical serialization, deserialization, structural comparison, and trace inspection. Exact source identity, required input cardinality, documentary order, opaque value preservation, reservations, scientific decisions where applicable, and failure atomicity are normative.

### Strategy prescription

Every algorithm was treated as a compilation input. No intermediate pseudocode list was copied as a mandatory total order. Each package uses a `partially_constrained` strategy: validation, preservation, metadata completion, and atomic publication are ordered only where observably necessary.

### Scientific boundary

No package evaluates a scientific constraint, dynamic, equation, metric, operator, or relation. Admissible packages return external-provider errors for scientific execution or evaluation. Blocked packages preserve exact decision sets and return `scientific_decision_required` for evaluation while continuing to support structural operations.

### Runtime boundary

Only immutable public results, invisible later input changes, deterministic structural serialization, documentary order, and no observable partial result are prescribed. Ownership, allocation, layout, aliasing, alignment, address stability, transport mechanism, and concurrency remain implementation-defined or unconstrained.

### Error identifiers

Authoritative lower-case error meanings are preserved one-to-one in schema-compatible uppercase public codes. Every public error condition and acceptance expectation records the original lower-case `source_error_id`. This is a local transport representation decision, not a scientific change.

### Shared contracts

All packages reuse the eight existing handoff shared contracts. No shared contract was created or modified. Two local recurring structures were recorded as `candidate_only` because premature factorization could erase feature-specific semantics.

## Preserved ambiguities and deferred features

Scientific evaluation is deferred for `TLC-FC-13-PRACTICE-004`, `006`, `008`, `010`, and `012`. Scientific execution or evaluation also remains external-provider-dependent for the other five packages. `TLC-FC-13-PRACTICE-012` additionally preserves unresolved endpoint identity and provisional separation.

The inventory naming difference (`population_count` versus `feature_count`) was verified against required CI. The validator accepts the authoritative `population_count: 10` key directly, so no compatibility alias or domain-finalization change was necessary.

## Protected-scope confirmation

- No scientific source was modified.
- No mathematical contract, source IR, test plan, finalized IR, algorithm, oracle, domain-finalization artifact, schema, shared contract, workflow, validator, or global catalog was modified.
- No implementation code was added.
- No package from another domain was modified.
- All writes are under the ten Practice feature directories, `handoff/domains/practice/`, and `reports/handoff/practice/`.

## Validation state

Feature handoff validation run `30283139415` completed successfully on commit `593ab0d92fb6f458cf203add1b6007d7a56c4d0c`. JSON Schema validation, package coherence, progressive population scenarios, shared dependency resolution, and pilot bundle resolution all passed. The final report-only head must pass the same workflow before squash merge.
