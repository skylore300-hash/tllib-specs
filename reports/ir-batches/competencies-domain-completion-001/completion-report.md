## Initial state

The manifest and preparation registers state `preparation_complete_with_reservations`, with 13 declared features and 0 expected canonical contracts, IRs, or test plans.

## Artefacts reused

- `maths/12-competencies/competencies.md` as authoritative source only; it was not modified.
- `registry/domain-progress/competencies/feature-catalogue.yaml` as primary planned catalogue.
- `registry/domain-progress/competencies/production-readiness.yaml` for readiness and blockers.
- `registry/domain-progress/competencies/scientific-inventory.yaml` for object names, source statements, symbols, and provenance.

## Artefacts created

- 13 canonical contracts under `registry/math-contracts/<FEATURE-ID>/contract.yaml`.
- 13 canonical IRs under `registry/ir/<FEATURE-ID>/ir.yaml`.
- 13 canonical test plans under `registry/test-plans/<FEATURE-ID>/test-plan.yaml`.
- Domain validator: `scripts/validate_competencies_domain.py`.
- Machine-readable batch manifest: `registry/ir-batches/competencies-domain-completion-001/manifest.yaml`.

## Artefacts consolidated and historical artefacts conserved

No historical competencies canonical contracts, canonical IRs, canonical test plans, or limited lots were present to migrate. Preparation artefacts are conserved as provenance and readiness evidence.

## Blockages and scientific questions

- Scientific unresolved blockers are propagated and not resolved.
- Types, dimensions, units, thresholds, initial conditions, and temporal semantics are not invented.
- Numeric oracle, precision, stability, gradient, conservation, monotonicity, and executable-equation tests remain blocked unless future scientific decisions authorize executable semantics.
- Features marked with `capacities_dependency: external_unreconciled` preserve that classification.

## Validation results

- PASS: `git diff --check`.
- PASS: `python scripts/validate_competencies_domain.py` reported 13 features, 13 contracts, 13 IRs, and 13 test plans with no maths changes or new artifact.yaml.
- PASS: PyYAML parsed 40 added/modified YAML files.
- PASS: no modified path under `maths/`.
- PASS: no added or modified `artifact.yaml`.
- PASS: canonical counts match catalogue: 13/13/13/13.
- PASS: every IR references `registry/math-contracts/<FEATURE-ID>/contract.yaml`.
- PASS: every test plan references the corresponding feature, contract, and IR.
- WARNING: `PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages python scripts/validate_competencies_preparation.py` remains preparation-scope-only and reports the new completion artifacts as out of scope; this is expected for the prior preparation validator.

## Modified files

See batch manifest `modified_files` for the complete expected list.

## Conclusion

Structural completion is achieved honestly for all 13 canonical competencies features: every catalogue feature has exactly one canonical contract, one canonical declarative IR, and one canonical test plan, while scientific executability remains non-executable where unsupported by authorized sources.
