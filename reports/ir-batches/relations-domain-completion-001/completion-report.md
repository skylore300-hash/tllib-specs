# Relations domain completion report

## Execution

- Execution id: `wave-3-relations-domain-completion-001`
- Domain: `relations`
- Base commit: `22c4317c8b443dda3b3bc787c20b9c21efb91be8`
- Source authority: `execution-manifests/wave-3/relations-domain-completion.yaml` plus repository preparation artifacts.
- Maths source: `maths/15-relations/relations.md` (read only; not modified).

## Canonical catalogue evidence

The complete canonical Relations catalogue is derived from `registry/domain-progress/relations/feature-inventory.yaml`, which declares `features_total: 5` and lists exactly:

1. `TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-002`
2. `TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-003`
3. `TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-004`
4. `TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-007`
5. `TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-008`

The limited batch containing `004` and `007` was audited as a limited batch only, not as the complete catalogue.

## Initial state

- Domain preparation existed with reservations.
- Limited contracts existed for `004` and `007`.
- Canonical IR and test-plan paths were absent for the Relations domain.
- Missing contracts for `002`, `003`, and `008` were non-executable because the preparation plan marks them gated by scientific decisions.

## Reuse and consolidation

### Reused active contracts

- `registry/math-contracts/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-004/contract.yaml`
- `registry/math-contracts/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-007/contract.yaml`

These remain active limited contracts with reservations. Their historical companion files (`dependencies.yaml`, `traceability.yaml`, `unresolved.yaml`, `validation-criteria.yaml`) were preserved.

### Created contracts

- `registry/math-contracts/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-002/contract.yaml`
- `registry/math-contracts/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-003/contract.yaml`
- `registry/math-contracts/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-008/contract.yaml`

These are canonical structural contracts and explicitly non-executable.

### Created IR

- `registry/ir/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-002/ir.yaml`
- `registry/ir/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-003/ir.yaml`
- `registry/ir/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-004/ir.yaml`
- `registry/ir/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-007/ir.yaml`
- `registry/ir/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-008/ir.yaml`

Each IR references its canonical contract and propagates blockers rather than inventing execution semantics.

### Created test plans

- `registry/test-plans/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-002/test-plan.yaml`
- `registry/test-plans/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-003/test-plan.yaml`
- `registry/test-plans/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-004/test-plan.yaml`
- `registry/test-plans/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-007/test-plan.yaml`
- `registry/test-plans/TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-008/test-plan.yaml`

The plans cover structural, property, determinism, reproducibility, Python/C++ conformance, and explicit-blocking tests. Numeric oracle tests remain non-goals.

## Classifications and readiness

| Feature | Classification | Python readiness | C++ readiness | Execution status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-002` | computational contract, blocked | blocked | blocked | non-executable |
| `TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-003` | validation contract, blocked | blocked | blocked | non-executable |
| `TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-004` | limited operator contract | blocked | blocked | declarative IR only |
| `TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-007` | limited relation contract | blocked | blocked | declarative IR only |
| `TLC-FC-15-RELATIONS-008` | relational contract, blocked | blocked | blocked | non-executable |

## Blockers and scientific questions

- `scientific_decision_required`
- `signature_not_specified`
- `types_not_specified`
- `oracle_not_identified`
- `relation_semantics_unresolved`
- Required scientific question: what authorized relation semantics, types, domains, codomains, temporal behavior, and oracle should each feature use?

## Validation results

Final validation results are recorded after command execution in the PR body and final response. The validator added for this lot is `scripts/validate_relations_domain_completion.py`.

## Modified files

See `registry/ir-batches/relations-domain-completion-001/manifest.yaml` for the machine-readable list of created/reused artifacts.

## Conclusion

Relations is structurally complete at the same artifact level as the referenced wave-2 domains: every canonical feature has one canonical contract, one canonical IR, and one canonical test plan. Completion is honest and non-executable where scientific information is unresolved.

## Final validation command results

- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `/usr/bin/python3` PyYAML parsing of added/modified YAML: passed for 14 YAML files.
- `scripts/validate_relations_domain_completion.py`: passed for 5 canonical features.
- `/usr/bin/python3 scripts/validate_relations_preparation.py`: blocked by local environment because `origin/main` remote ref is unavailable.
- `git diff --name-only | rg '^maths/'`: passed, no `maths/` changes.
- `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | rg '(^|/)artifact\.yaml$'`: passed, no new `artifact.yaml`.
- Exact counts check: catalogue=5, contracts=5, IR=5, test plans=5, references ok.
